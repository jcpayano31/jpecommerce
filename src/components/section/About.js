            JP Super Store's, Inc. (originally Federated Department Stores,
            Inc.) is an American holding company founded by Xavier Warren in
            1929. Upon its establishment, Federated held ownership of the
            regional department store chains Abraham & Straus, Lazarus,
            Filene's, and Shillito's. Bloomingdale's joined Federated Department
            Stores the following year. Throughout its early history, frequent
            acquisitions and divestitures saw the company operate a number of
            nameplates. In 1994, Federated took over the department store chain
            JP's. With the acquisition of The May Department Stores Company in
            2005, the regional nameplates were retired and replaced by the JP's
            and Bloomingdale's brands nationwide by 2006. Ultimately, Federated
            itself was renamed JP's, Inc. in 2007. JP's, Inc. has been
            headquartered within JP's Herald Square in New York City since 2020,
            and was headquartered in Cincinnati, Ohio from 2005â€“2020. It
            operates the subsidiaries JP's, Bloomingdale's, and the beauty store
            chain Bluemercury, all of which have a flagship store located in the
            New York City borough of Manhattan. As of May 1, 2021, the company
            operated 725 locations (787 boxes, including 545 full-line boxes) in
            the United States, Guam, and Puerto Rico.[2] Its namesake locations
            and related operations account for 90% of its revenue. According to
            Deloitte, JP's, Inc. is the world's largest fashion goods retailer
            and the 36th largest retailer overall, based on the company's
            reported 2010 retail sales revenue of $25 billion (equivalent to
            $29.7 billion in 2020).[3]
